## Definitions

### Factee
A non-social knowledge network. Every user is a mediator.

### Mediator
The mediator connects original articles and texts with their reworked facts. The mediator is only responsible for referencing and paraphrasing methods, not for the content itself.

### üí° Fact
Information that has been paraphrased and processed by the mediator based on a source. A fact is directly linked to its source. Each fact belongs to a single mediator and inherits the type of its source.

### üìÑ Source
The original text written by another author. Sources do not belong to users and are edited by the site.

## Responsibilities

### Mediator
Mediators may use site features to connect facts but must not intentionally harm the site or its users. The site strongly recommends considering your privacy when filling in profile data, such as email, name, and username.

Unsubscribed mediators have a limited number of facts they can create, while a subscription increases this limit.

### Site
- The site has the right to modify source data but not facts. Sources are edited according to the established criteria.
- The site does not verify user identities. Authentication via third-party software (Keycloak) only confirms email addresses per their documentation.
- The site is not responsible for links to articles attached by mediators.
- Deleted facts or sources retain a minimized version in their link parameters, but this can be modified by anyone when shared.
- The site strives to follow APA citation norms.

### Host
The site host is responsible for infrastructure below the application level.

### Source
The reference from which the information is cited or interpreted more freely.
